# Hi! I am Jiuder Guillen 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jiuder/jiuder/master/banner jiuder.jpg" alt="banner that says Jiuder Guillen - Full Stack Web Dev, WordPress plugin Dev,  Unreal Games Dev">
  I’m web site developer. I have a degree in systems engineer graduated from UNEFA in Maracay, Venezuela. I’ve been working in the area about 3 years. I have experience in using tools such as: node.js, Laravel, MySQL, vue.js, MongoDB and some web programming language like; JavaScript, Go, PHP, SQL, Java.
I love working with WordPress because of its open-source system and its modular architecture which is implemented within a plugin manager and theme system makes web development faster.
  However, I consider that each tool should be used correctly in order to carry out the analysis of the requirements, the data and the work models to recommend the development environment that best suits the needs of each project.
  I believe that to achieve the objectives of a project, there must be always good communication with the development team and should be a pleasant and coordinated atmosphere where all members can express their opinions and ideas without being judged.
I am an enthusiastic guy who is always willing to learn new things. Among my hobbies are video games, to mention a few such as: Borderlands, Metro Exodus, Bioshock series. I also enjoy watching movies in my spare time.
